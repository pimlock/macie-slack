# Amazon Macie - Slack integration 

[SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) application that automatically sends notification for alerts generated by [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/).

## Setup

#### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlock/macie-slack.git
cd macie-slack
```

#### Install dev dependencies (make sure you are using Python3)

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

#### Create Virtualenv:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Create CloudFormation stack

This step requires your AWS credentials to be set up:
* as `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""`
* stored in `~/.aws/credentials`

Create required S3 buckets:

1. Where CloudFormation will upload Lambda code to (`CODE_DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET`)

```bash
# this bucket is where the zip file with AWSLambda code will be uploaded (it's used by CloudFormation to deploy Lambda)
export CODE_DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET=my-bucket

# creates deployable package for CloudFormation
scripts/package.sh

export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=url
# creates/updates the CloudFormation stack
scripts/deploy.sh
```
